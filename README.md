#Example Parse.com Configuration for Platform.Sh

Parse are retiring their service .. and people will need to find alternate methods to host their code (while probably migrating to some other service).

Anyway,  Platform.sh has everything that is needed to run a Parse server (unlike  other providers you don't need an external service for MongoDB).

So this is a quick example of running it. We follow the official example from:
